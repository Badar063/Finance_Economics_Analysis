Financial Markets & Economic Indicators Analysis
Project Overview
This project delivers a comprehensive analysis of financial markets and economic indicators across multiple dimensions, including stock volatility, personal spending behavior, portfolio performance, macroeconomic correlations and cryptocurrency trends. The objective is to generate actionable insights through statistical analysis and data visualization.
